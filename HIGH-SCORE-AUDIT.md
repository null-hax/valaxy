# High Score Functionality Audit

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the high score functionality in the Valaxy Arcade game, including identified issues and implemented fixes.

## Architecture

The high score system uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Primary Storage**: Supabase database for persistent storage
2. **Secondary Storage**: In-memory cache on the server as a fallback
3. **Tertiary Storage**: Local storage in the browser as a client-side backup

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Entries in Database

**Problem**: Multiple identical scores were being stored in the database with different UUIDs.

**Root Causes**:
- New UUIDs were generated for each score in multiple places in the code
- The `onConflict: 'id'` parameter in the upsert operation only prevented conflicts on the ID field, not on the actual score data
- Multiple attempts to save the same score in different ways (direct insert, RPC, etc.)

**Fix**:
- Streamlined the score submission process to reduce duplicate attempts
- Improved duplicate detection logic to consider name, score, and wave
- Enhanced the sorting logic to prioritize higher scores and newer dates

### 2. Inconsistent MAX_HIGH_SCORES Value

**Problem**: There was confusion between storing 100 scores in the database vs. displaying 5 scores in the UI.

**Fix**:
- Added a clear constant `DISPLAY_HIGH_SCORES = 5` to distinguish between storage and display limits
- Updated documentation to clarify that we store 100 scores but only display 5
- Ensured consistent use of these limits throughout the codebase

### 3. Inefficient Duplicate Removal

**Problem**: The duplicate removal logic was too simple and didn't handle edge cases well.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the `removeDuplicateScores` function to:
  - Sort scores by score (highest first) and date (newest first)
  - Use a more sophisticated key generation based on name and score
  - Keep the entry with the highest wave when duplicates are found
  - Re-sort results before returning

### 4. Multiple Attempts to Save Scores in POST Handler

**Problem**: The POST handler had multiple sections that attempted to save scores, which could lead to race conditions or duplicate entries.

**Fix**:
- Simplified the POST handler logic to follow a clear sequence:
  1. Try stored procedure first (most reliable)
  2. Fall back to direct insert if RPC fails
  3. Update in-memory cache regardless of database success
- Added better error handling and logging throughout

### 5. Vercel KV References

**Problem**: The codebase contained references to Vercel KV, but we're using Supabase.

**Fix**:
- Removed the Vercel KV dependency from package.json
- Deleted the README-VERCEL-KV.md file
- Updated README-HIGHSCORES.md to focus on Supabase as the recommended solution

### 6. Improved Logging

**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it difficult to debug high score issues.

**Fix**:
- Added more detailed logging throughout the high score functionality
- Included specific log messages for each step of the save/load process
- Added logging for local storage operations to help with debugging

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Play the game and achieve a high score**
   - The score should be saved to Supabase
   - The score should appear in the high score list
   - No duplicate entries should be created

2. **Test fallback mechanisms**
   - Temporarily disable Supabase access to verify local storage fallback
   - Verify that the in-memory cache works as expected

3. **Check duplicate handling**
   - Submit the same score multiple times
   - Verify that only one entry is created in the database

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication**: Add player authentication for verified high scores
2. **Leaderboards by Time**: Implement daily, weekly, and all-time leaderboards
3. **Additional Statistics**: Track more player statistics beyond just score and wave
4. **Admin Interface**: Create a separate admin interface for managing high scores
